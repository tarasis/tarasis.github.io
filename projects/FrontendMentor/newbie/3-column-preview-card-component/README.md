## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I was rusty as I hadn't touched html/css/javascript in 7 months. Solution came together fairly quickly.

As usual I focused on mobile first, and then added some minor tweaks for desktop. (Specifically the "Learn More" button is lower on the desktop version)

I spent a little time chasing box widths, mainly it was paragraph width. Honestly I should have simply stayed with the `25ch` used for the mobile version rather than having `23.15ch` for the desktop.

### Continued development

Continue working through the `newbie` projects that I have, with an eye to trying to use `grid` rather than `flexbox`.
