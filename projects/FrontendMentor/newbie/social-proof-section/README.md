## My process

As usual, I started Mobile first. I setup CSS properties for colors, typography and such. After a bit I realised that the font needed was different from when I originally downloaded the starter kit for this challenge. Which meant that my variables were off.

Once I'd finished the mobile version, I re-arranged the HTML slightly because I forgot to make a top and bottom section.

I had little problem with the alignments for the ratings and reviews, but I did end up waisting an hour chasing desktop alignment with design image. I just couldn't quite nail it.

I also played a bit with where the desktop version should start.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid (only for positioning in the middle of the page )
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

To check for updated files.

Don't chase perfection.
### Continued development

Practice practice and practice.
