<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot](./screenshot.png)

Fairly responsive build of this error page. Most font sizes and line heights have been scaled using the [responsive font calculator](https://websemantics.uk/tools/responsive-font-calculator/).

At 800px `min-width` a number of CSS properties are updating for the larger screen layout.

Took a different approach than normal with splitting CSS between font settings and then positional settings. Honestly I find the approach both easier but also increased cognitive load a little. As I'm needing to think about where things are.

I should have used more classes rather than class + html attribute (i.e. `.text-container p`)


### Built With

Pure HTML & CSS, although making heavy use of CSS Properties and dynamic sizing.
