## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

### Screenshot

Two screenshots, the first is the Desktop solution, then the mobile solution. The mobile is the closest, I decided not to chase doing getting the Desktop one spot on.

## My process

This was a little tricky just from the point of view that I hadn't done any HTML/CSS dev / study in 9 months. So it was a case of trying to remind myself of various options that I could do.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

The main thing was to just let my solution go. In previous ones I would iterate lots to make it as close as I felt I could make it.

As I did most of this one a couple of weeks ago and forgot to take notes I can't really comment on anything else I learnt.
