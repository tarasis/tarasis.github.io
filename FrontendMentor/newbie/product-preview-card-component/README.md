## My process

Standard for me so far. Set up CSS properties for most things.
Then I built the mobile version of the page.
Made minor changes for the desktop version.
Added a Light/Dark switcher, just to show updating the variables to change the colors.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox (for some alignment)
- CSS Grid (just for putting in the middle of the page)
- Mobile-first workflow

## Acknowledgments

Two articles gave me the setup for the Light / Dark switcher I've set up. The first by [Musthaq Ahamad](https://medium.com/@haxzie/dark-and-light-theme-switcher-using-css-variables-and-pure-javascript-zocada-dd0059d72fa2) gave the JavaScript, but I didn't want to have it as a sliding button and with using a class for dark mode. For handling that I used ideas from [Luke Lowrey's](https://lukelowrey.com/css-variable-theme-switcher/) implementation, using data attributes.
