## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Fluid Sizing (so no media queries)
- Nesting & `@layer`

### What I learned

Main thing I learnt is that I find it difficult to split out css across multiple files. I understand the principle but working out what goes where is tricky.

### Continued development


### Useful resources

- [Utopia](https://utopia.fyi/space/calculator) for its wonderful fluid space calculator.
- [Polypane](https://polypane.app/) for making it super easy to see how the build looks at mobile & desktop sizes.
