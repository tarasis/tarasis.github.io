These are completed projects done to practice using HTML, CSS & Javascript. They come from different sources, and most are freely available for anyone to practice with. Where not, I'll indicate if it is from a premium source.

I've put them all into a single GIT repository rather than litter my git service with many different projects. This may change in future depending on how many of these that I do.
